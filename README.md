### THIS IS NOT BEING MANTAINED

# Why did you update, bruh?

### Wat?

![](http://i.imgur.com/Ui8YUBe.png)

A function that monkey patches React and notifies you in the console when **potentially** unnecessary re-renders occur. Super helpful for easy perf gainzzzzz.

### Install
```js
npm install --save-dev why-did-you-update
```

### How to

```js
import React from 'react'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const {whyDidYouUpdate} = require('why-did-you-update')
  whyDidYouUpdate(React)
}
```

You can include or exclude components by their displayName with the `include` and `exclude` options

```js
whyDidYouUpdate(React, { include: /^pure/, exclude: /^Connect/ })
```

By default, the changes for each component are grouped by component and these groups collapsed. This can be changed with the `groupByComponent` and `collapseComponentGroups` options:

```js
whyDidYouUpdate(React, { groupByComponent: true, collapseComponentGroups: false })
```

### Credit

I originally read about how Benchling created a mixin to do this on a per component basis ([A deep dive into React perf debugging](http://benchling.engineering/deep-dive-react-perf-debugging/)).
That is really awesome but also tedious AF, so why not just monkey patch React.
