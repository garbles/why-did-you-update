### Wat?

![](http://i.imgur.com/Ui8YUBe.png)

A function that monkey patches React and notifies you in the console when **potentially** unnecessary re-renders occur. Super helpful for easy perf gainzzzzz.

### How to

```js
import React from 'react';
import {whyDidYouUpdate} from 'why-did-you-update';

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  whyDidYouUpdate(React);
}
```

You can include or exclude components by their displayName with the include and exclude options

```js
whyDidYouUpdate(React, { include: /^pure/, exclude: /^Connect/ });
```

You can exclude multiple components by their displayName using an array. Note: this only works with strings for now

```js
whyDidYouUpdate(React, { exclude: ['Connect', 'DevTools']});
```

### Credit

I originally read about how Benchling created a mixin to do this on a per component basis ([A deep dive into React perf debugging](http://benchling.engineering/deep-dive-react-perf-debugging/)).
That is really awesome but also tedious AF, so why not just monkey patch React.
